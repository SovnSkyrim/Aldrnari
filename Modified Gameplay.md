# The video game has been modified

![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/qOPBy7D.png)

Yes, with 2200+ Mods, the game has changed quite a lot. I will try to describe, in the most comprehensive manner, what exactly the list is and what goal it's trying to achieve.
I will start with what the list isn't.

## What the list isn't

This is not a list for thieves, pickpockets, or assassins. Such archetypes and skill trees have been nerfed. Why? I simply don't enjoy such builds and it is to discourage you from playing these types of builds. [RAID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2345) is set to high on both interiors and exteriors; furthermore, no additional tools for assassins are added, unlike QWEST! which has Sneak Tools.
The quest mods, combat, magic and gameplay overhauls are chosen for warriors, paladins, mages, and wizards.

This is not a list for Legacy of the Dragonborn (LotD) and item hoarders. LotD is not in simply because I do not like how it forces you to become an item hoarder. I made QWEST! for the ultimate LotD experience, and now I'm making the complete opposite.
LotD also displays the lowest quality armor and weapons mods in my opinion (Looking at you, Immersive Armors and Immersive Weapons). To compensate that lack, I've handplaced hundreds of items throughout the world such as spell tomes, weapons or gave unique NPCs unique gear like in From Software's games.
You're free from hoarding random items, and you have cool player homes with room for displaying what you want, not what LotD deemed worthy. [This is the kind of behavior I hope to avoid](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/747132474647248917/855547604561297428/unknown.png).
Even the [Dev Aveza](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24587), my favourite part of LotD, is in, without being held back.

This is not a list centered around "immersion and roleplay". Mods like [Sunhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) are deliberately not present. Survival Mode is not patched in and incompatible out of the box. [Keep it Clean](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17846) is also not in. Furthermore there are enemies from other games such as The Witcher 3 and Dark Souls Series.

## What the list is
## Gameplay - Combat | ADXP MCO, dodging, AIs and Parrying

[ADXP MCO](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/distars-mods/adxp-mco) is the core combat mod of the list; in a nutshell, it's attack commitment. If you attack, you commit to it therefor you cannot moove. You also loose stamina. It's the core, all animations revolve around it. Don't worry though [Everyone's Stamina Matters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50502) makes it so your enemies are also struggling.

Now to dodge, there's [TK Dodge RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956), to overhaul AI there's [SCAR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72014), to make sure you hit all enemies we got [Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347). Finally, to overhaul parrying we got [Elden Parry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70240) combined with [Elden Counter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65579).

Now for some other mods to make an ever more Dark Souls-inspired combat experience;

- [ZUPA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45182) forces 3rd person and plays an animation when drinking a potion, like how there's an animation for Estus in Dark Souls.
- [Elden Rim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65625) will allow you to perform Weapon Arts. I highly suggest checking its modpage to understand how.
- [Hotkey Potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60243) is an add-on to ZUPA, so you don't have to go in your inventory to drink a potion!
- [Heartbreaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1847) allows you to rip people's hearts straight from their chest. Metal, isn't it?
- [SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252) and [True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) for the camera control, so it's actually usable in 3rd person.
- [Seamless Combat Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53856) will force you in 3rd person for every fight. You will only be able to fight in third person, and that's intended. There are no first person combat mods in the list.
- [Bow Rapid Combo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65461) give way more tools to archers as melee charaters have so much.

### Gameplay - Combat | Enemies

Enemies will be drastically changed; I have made a very thorough merge of many popular enemy overhauls, completely patched to work together. We are talking about mods like:
- [Skyrim Revamped - Complete Enemies Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14598) which buffs almost all enemies in the game.
- [Briraka's Draugr Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26188) and [Draugr Upgrades and Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21775) which makes named draugr more unique and brings varieties like fire draugr to the game.
- [OBIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4145) the unavoidable bandits overhaul, with its Patrols addon.
- [Better Vampires NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9510#) with [Ubervamps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28919) which makes them an actual threat. I also added my own, unique, non available on nexus mod; **Sovn's Ebony Vampires - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim**.
- [Heritage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30017) which brings more enemy variants to almost all classes.
- [High Level Enemies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3231) which, instead of the usual more variants, adds level 60+ enemies into leveled lists. 
- [Real Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18183) because Skyrim Revamped does not touch bosses, for some reason, so this overhauls those to make sure the minions aren't stronger than the actual boss.
- [SkyTEST](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1104) for animals only so they are an actual threat passed level 5.
- [Dragon Combat Overhaul UPGRADED BABY YEAH](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56082) will make you run for your life when facing dragons. Especially coupled with [Deadly Dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23723), [Diverse Dragons Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/695) and [Splendor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9670).
- My very own **Sovn's Enchanted Spheres - Porting Requiem Enemies to Vanilla Skyrim** to bring some actual bosses in Dwarven ruins.
- A set of 30+ Mihail Mods, which adds new enemies that dot the landscape. You can find them in the modlist under "MM -".
- [Skyrim Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680) is now fixed, implementing a ton of new enemies which will obviously help a lot bringing diversity to the world!

Those are only the most prominent overhauls present. The above list isn't exhaustive.

"Wow Sovn, this is some madness! How am I supposed to survive?" Well listen here buddy, **the Encounter Zones are handmade**.

That's right, I heavily modified [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681)'s encounter zones. For the first couple levels early on, you will want to fight bandits. They should be as bad at combat as you. As you progress through doing [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) or normal quests due to [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751), you will get more enemies with more perks, and you will be able to do more and more stuff.

More on that in the next chapter of this guide.

## Gameplay - Leveling

Bandits are the best enemy in the beginning; they barely know how to fight (except their leaders) and aren't that organized. As you progress, you should be able to tackle stronger enemies such as draugr, forsworn, mages, dwarven constructions, dragons, and finally vampires and dragon priests.

Vampires are deceptively strong, do not fight them early, you will get murdered. Why? Because the game is **semi-leveled**; lemme explain:
- Normal enemies still scale with you, they start at lower levels and have a lot of variants between level 1 and 90.
- Bosses are higher level by default, between level 15 and 250 (that includes quest mods). There are a lot of static bosses that are straight up god-like, such as Master Vampires and Dragon Priests.
- All enemies get perks depending on their level. A level 1 enemy has 1 perk and a level 60 enemy has 60 perks.

**"But how do you get to the higher levels yourself? How do you even train your combat skills if everyone kills you"** - I am glad you asked! Let me introduce you to the 2 core mods for Player leveling:

- **[Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751)**
- **[Static Skill Leveling - Experience Mod Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30410)**
- **[Static Skill Leveling Alternative Level Up Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62027)**

You will level up by discovering places, killing any enemy, and doing quests. Your stats do not influence your leveling at all, that is [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) Here is what the add-on changes: **You will be able to allocate your skill points before you select the bonus in Health/Stamina/Magicka in the skill menu**. This allows you to refine your character.

But that isn't all there is to help you on your quest to becoming a god among men. Let's talk about the main overhauls.


## Gameplay - Main Overhauls | Perks, Races, Standing Stones, Magic, Religion and Alchemy

So I mostly play with **EnaiRim**, especially the full overhauls, and that isn't going to change *too much*. Lemme show you:

- **[Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137)** for main perks.
- **[Growl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31245)** for werewolf perks.
- **[Sacrosanct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3928)** for vampire perks.

They have been choosen because they enable many different playstyles and also make you very powerful. Remember, we're not trying to nerf the player, just buff the enemies.

- **[Palladium Racials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43890)**

One of the deviations from main EnaiRim. Why? Because it allows both NPCs and the Player to use its passive effects, and it has parts of Imperious along with parts of other race overhauls. It will also bring a good diversity of potential builds.

- **[Andromeda](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14910)**

Good old Andromeda; still as OP as the old days!

- **[Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000)** for vanilla spells.
- **[Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)** and **[Triumvirate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170)** for added spells.
- **[Forgotten Magic Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12711)** for reward spells. (more info below)
- **[Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612)** for artifact enchantments.

I really wanted a certain spell that loots bodies around you from Odin, so it's how this one got chosen over Mysticism. Many have suggested Arcanum in my old list, so I'm giving it a chance here. Trust me, there's more than enough spells for any type of mage with this setup, so no need for Apocalypse or similar large package mods! Forgotten Magic Redone's tomes have been **handplaced throughout the world, quest mods included, so they're rewarded at completion of quests and key moments in the game**. Let's be honest, that mod's spells are absolutely OP, and they're supposed to be lost, so why would a merchant sell them in the Bannered Mare? A notes with hints on where to get them lies on a bench where knowledge is gathered within Skyrim. Triumvirate just makes sense, due to some spells fitting the atmosphere.

- **[Spell Tutor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45275)** and **[FIZZLE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18180)**

Spell Tutor overhauls the learning process, makes learning spells like a trial to actually learn them. FIZZLE makes sure you don't cast anything too high level too often.

- **[Summermyst](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285)**

You will find those enchantements on spell tomes, when defeating strong enemies. Good hunting!

- **[Ultimate Shouts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57722)** and **[Thunderchild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1460)**

One makes shouts actually viable, the other adds new shouts! That's about it really, have fun with new cool stuff!

- **[Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)**

Provides quite a few deities to follow; to make your character even stronger than it already is.

- **[Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130)**

I have sworn to never use kryptopyr's CACO ever again. This overhaul does *exactly* what it needs to do and is actually not a pain to patch. This is why it has been chosen. 
We use both the Main mod and it's Food addon!

You have all the tools to conquer the world thanks to the absurd strength and overpowered items, but those tools are also available to your enemies which will be forever challenging.

## Gameplay - Less known available tools.

The main overhauls are what define most of your strenght; but a lot has been added on the side so you can clutch boss fights with a well prepared arsenal.

#### [ScrollScribe SE - A Scroll Crafting Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32439)

You will very quickly notice how almost every bandit has access to magic.. sound annoying right? Especially since magic is quite overpowered in this list.
Fear not, you have also access to very strong spells, that only get stronger, despite your lack of mana!

Welcome to Scrollscribe, simply go to an inn and use the power in your magic tab to see how you can craft scrolls! Just requires paper and soul gem dust!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32439) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [Alchemist Arsenal - Arrows Bolts Bombs and Traps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030)

Always wanted to be a mad scientist in Skyrim? Welcome to Alchemist Arsenal! The first step of your journey is to visit a Alchemy vendor and purchase "The Alchemist Arsenal Guide" in one of the major cities. This is a Book / Journal that will allow you to build the kit at a forge.
Afterward, with your newfound knowledage, you can make some really cool weapons

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [Mystic Condenser](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10176)

Good job, you've killed a bandit camp, you now have 50 minor potion of healing, but you really dont want to use them as you have that animation when taking potions.. Is it still worth taking them? Yup it is! Thanks to Mystic Condenser, you can merge those little potions into bigger ones!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10176) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [Dragonborn - Shouts Perk Tree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41950)

Once the Way of the Voice done; you will unlock a new power: *“Ysmir Meditation”*. It will allow you to access a perk tree dedicated to shout empowering.

Use your shouts to get experience and levels in that new perk tree; and become the strongest shout wielding hero known to Nirn.

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41950) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [Vitrium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57242)

It's a tools pack, with cool animation, every buff is really significant: from bonus damage, imbuing your weapon with an element like a resin in Dark Souls or a temporary ward!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57242) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [Conduit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58023)

When holding a weapon in one hand and a spell in the other, you are able to temporarily "conduct" the spell through that weapon. Different categories of spells make the weapon do different things!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58023) if you wanna dive deeper into it.

#### [The Wizard Warrior](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14890)

Last but no least, The Wizard Warrior allows for spellcasting via weapons. It is the absolute dreams for any spellsword character.

Only downside: gatekept behind 80 Destruction, so it's not available right off the bat. But it's a build defining mod for sure!

Check out the [modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14890) if you wanna dive deeper into it. But keep in mind the mod's obtention of the spells and shouts are behind the perk, a specificity of the list!

Now that the bulk of the gameplay has been covered, I will continue on the atmosphere of the list.

## Visuals - Atmosphere and Weathers
### Welcome to Berserkyr ENB

**[Berserkyr ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62381)** by JPSteel2 is probably the most nordic looking ENB Preset out there.

If you wish to try other stuff, **[PRT XII](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4743)** still holds up as the best suite of effects for you to tinker.

### Visuals - City Overhauls

- Base is [JK's Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71018) for most cities.
- Riverwood has [Galaxy's Riverwood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46360) it gives it a look.

- Whiterun is now real fortified place thanks to [Fortified Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40094). It also has a lot of hand-placed trees so its connection to Kyne is felt throughout the city.
- Solitude now feels like a capital city with [The Great City of Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22243), [Drengin's Blue Palace Terrace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35180) and [Solitude Skyway](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8250) fully patched together!
- Windhelm also feels like a capital, with [Capital Windhelm Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42990) and [City Entrances Overhaul: Windhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19400)
- Riften is now a real influencial fishing port thanks to [Riften Docks Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40021) and gains some verticality thanks to [RYFTEN suite of mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/939721?tab=user+files).
- Markarth's wall is now massive thanks to [City Entrances Overhaul: Markarth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37375)
- "The Great City" Series overhauls a good number of minor towns and cities; we're talking  [Mixwater Mill](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36350), [Karthwasten](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33032), [Kynesgrove](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42639), [Old Hroldan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33189), [Ivarstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34505) and [Shor's Stone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35977).
- Rorikstead by [Redbag](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56114)!
- Dragon Bridge is overhauled by [Rodryk](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42510)
- Raven Rock isn't forgotten, we use [Quaint Raven Rock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20851)
- [Sepolcri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34105) makes sure the cemeteries in Solitude, Riften, and Falkreath aren't lame.
- [Viking Towns of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17132) and [Lyngwi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13526) are two mods adding Nordic-looking cities on top of everything that is above! 
- Interiors are massively overhauled thanks to [jkrojmal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1305814?tab=user+files)'s Interior series, in combination with [Distinct Interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6130) and [EEK's Whiterun Interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10463); all working together thanks to [Czasior's Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/9933289?tab=user+files)

### Visuals - Armors and Weapons

I love high quality armors and weapons. We are talking assets from Team TAL, Christine, FunkyGandalfCat, JS, DX, and other renowned artist. This is why I am going on a journey to hand-place as many items as possible throughout the world in a lore friendly way.

As an example, I have distributed into Leveled Lists, thanks to [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681), weapons from [Skyrim Weapons Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32500) or [Team TAL's Mordhau Weapons Pack](https://www.patreon.com/posts/mordhau-weapon-1-28144583) or armors from [Team TAL's Mordhau Armors Pack](https://www.patreon.com/posts/alpha-mordhau-by-27867837). While some NPCs have unique armors, in a Dark Souls way.

Hand-placed items are not restricted to armors and weapons, you will find spell tomes and other cosmetic items at the end of dungeons. Lastly some armors' recipes have been gated behind quests! For example, if you want Serana's Vampire armor, you must complete some Dawnguard Quests before being able to create it for yourself.

You can also notice that not lorefriendly armors have been added to the list, like [Spindrift Knight](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53728) or [Grandmaster Wolven](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51572), those are still in the game! You will have access to them by taking 2 perks in the smithing tree:
- Hallowed Seamstress and Stoneweaver
  - For jewelry and dresses (Lore-Friendly)
- Senua's Wisdom
  - For items that are not Lore Friendly and/or Skimpy

This is made so you are not cluttered with 2000 free gear at level 1.

## Gameplay - Quests
### Gameplay - Main Questline, Daedric Quests, Miscellaneous Quests and DLCs

- [Skip The Opening Video](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49327) is the alternate start choice of Aldrnari. You'll spawn at Helgen's exit.

### Gameplay - Modified and Expanded Quests

- The Companions are heavily modified by [Don't be a milk drinker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19490), [questline tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22300) and [More Radiant quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24144)
- [Jiub's Opus gets quest markers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17056)
- [Goldenglow is Yours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25155) after you rob it but you will have [Requirements to enter the Thieves Guild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256)

- You can [save the Icerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34681)
- On top of [Jk's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65676), that questline has also an [Improved admission test](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22184), [enemies in Labyrinthian incentivize mage gameplay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44557) and there is [more tweaks from Obscure](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653).
- [You can avoid the entirety of the Forsworn conspiracy.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43850)

### Gameplay - New Quests
Gotta have quest mods if there is no Legacy of the Dragonborn, right? 

- **[VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849)** brings a Vigilant of Stendarr questline, featuring the never ending struggle against Molag Bal. Vicn's first quest mod. Heavily inspired by Dark Souls in its atmosphere, styles, combats, enemies, armors, and stories. Has the most tweaks of all the quest mods for the ultimate experience. Separated in 4 Acts. It is also my favourite quest mod.
- **[UNSLAAD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789)** is a Half Dragon quest mod. The second work of Vicn. Very similar to VIGILANT but with a way colder and sad atmosphere rather than dark and grim. Can also be quite wholesome per moments. Heavily inspired by Dark Souls. It is also my second favourite quest mod.
- **[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194)** Personal stories of many, _many_ NPCs hidden throughout the world. Many are followers and others are just quests. NPCs with more extensive dialogue and role-play choices. Over 250+ fully voiced NPCs, 25+ followers, 15+ marriage NPCs, and 50+ quests.
- **[The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179)** is the first mod in history to win a national Writers' Guild award for its script.

### Inigo...?

A majority of people like him. I personally don't. On top of that, users reported non-issues from other Wabbajack lists to his Nexus page which led them to make a public pinned post about their [non-favorable stance with what we do](http://prntscr.com/1b2tt18). He needs tweaks, he is too strong and unbalanced, all followers above have been tweaked, since I am not allowed to do so by the Mod Author, I will not include him. This decision is final.
